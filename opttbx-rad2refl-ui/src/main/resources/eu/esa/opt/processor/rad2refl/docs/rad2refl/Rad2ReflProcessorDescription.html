<h3>Processor Description</h3>

<h4>I/O Parameters Tab</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="images/Rad2ReflPaths.png"></p>

<h5>Source Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Name: </b>
    Used to select the spectral source product. The source product shall
    contain spectral bands providing a source spectrum at each pixel. Use the <b>...</b> button to
    open a data product currently not opened in the application.
</p>

<h5>Target Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Name:</b>
    Used to specify the name of the target product.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Save to:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be saved to the file system. The
    combo box presents a list of file formats.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Open in SNAP:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be opened in the application.
    When the target product is not saved, it is opened automatically.
</p>

<h3>The Processing Parameters</h3>

<p align="center"><img src="images/Rad2ReflParameter.png"></p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Sensor: </b><br>
    The corresponding sensor. The processor currently supports OLCI, SLSTR and MERIS.
    The sensor must be selected from the drop-down menu. The default sensor is 'OLCI'.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Conversion mode: </b><br>
    Specifies if the conversion shall be from radiances to reflectances or backwards.
    The conversion mode has one of the values 'RAD_TO_REFL', 'REFL_TO_RAD' and must be selected
    from the drop-down menu. The default conversion mode is 'RAD_TO_REFL'. The 'REFL_TO_RAD'
    mode is likely a rare use case and only supports input products which were generated with this
    processor using the 'RAD_TO_REFL' mode and which contain all tie point grids, flag bands and non-spectral
    bands from the original L1 product.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Copy tie point grids: </b><br>
    If set, all tie point grids from the source product are written to target product.
    The default value is 'false'.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Copy flag bands and masks: </b><br>
    If set, all flag bands and masks from the source product are written to target product.
    The default value is 'false'.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Copy non spectral bands: </b><br>
    If set, all other non-spectral bands from the source product are written to target product.
    The default value is 'false'.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    Note that writing these optional outputs might be time consuming i.e. in case of large OLCI or SLSTR products.
</p>
