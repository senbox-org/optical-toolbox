<h3>BWDRVI</h3>

<p>
    The BWDRVI operator algorithm computes the <u><b>B</b></u>lue <u><b>W</b></u>ide <u><b>D</b></u>ynamic <u><b>R</b></u>ange <u><b>V</b></u>egetation <u><b>I</b></u>ndex  from a given product. <br><br>
</p>


<p>
    The BWDRVI results from the following equation:
</p>

<p>
    <b>BWDRVI = (alpha * N - B) / (alpha * N + B)</b><br><br>
</p>

<p>
    , where: <br><br>
    The bands are: <br><br>
    - <b>B</b> is the <b>Blue</b> band <br/>- <b>N</b> is the <b>NIR</b> band <br/>
    <br><br>
    and the coefficients are:<br><br>
- <b>l</b> is the <b>Canopy background adjustment</b> coefficient <br/>- <b>alpha</b> is the <b>Weighting coefficient used for WDRVI, BWDRVI and NDPI</b> coefficient <br/>
</p>

<h3>BWDRVI-Flags</h3>

<p>
    Also the processor computes an additional flags band called 'bwdrvi_flags'
    with the following bit coding:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Bit Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 0</td><td>The computed value for BWDRVI is NAN or is Infinite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 1</td><td>The computed value for BWDRVI is less than -1 (minus one)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 2</td><td>The computed value for BWDRVI is greater than 1 (one)</td></tr>
