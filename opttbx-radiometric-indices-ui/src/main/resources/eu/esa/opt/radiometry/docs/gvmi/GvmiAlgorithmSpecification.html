<h3>GVMI</h3>

<p>
    The GVMI operator algorithm computes the <u><b>G</b></u>lobal <u><b>V</b></u>egetation <u><b>M</b></u>oisture <u><b>I</b></u>ndex  from a given product. <br><br>
</p>


<p>
    The GVMI results from the following equation:
</p>

<p>
    <b>GVMI = ((N + 0.1) - (S2 + 0.02)) / ((N + 0.1) + (S2 + 0.02))</b><br><br>
</p>

<p>
    , where: <br><br>
    The bands are: <br><br>
    - <b>N</b> is the <b>NIR</b> band <br/>- <b>S2</b> is the <b>SWIR 2</b> band <br/>
    <br><br>
    
</p>

<h3>GVMI-Flags</h3>

<p>
    Also the processor computes an additional flags band called 'gvmi_flags'
    with the following bit coding:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Bit Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 0</td><td>The computed value for GVMI is NAN or is Infinite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 1</td><td>The computed value for GVMI is less than -1 (minus one)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 2</td><td>The computed value for GVMI is greater than 1 (one)</td></tr>
</table>
