<h3>EVI</h3>

<p>
    The EVI operator algorithm computes the <u><b>E</b></u>nhanced <u><b>V</b></u>egetation <u><b>I</b></u>ndex  from a given product. <br><br>
</p>


<p>
    The EVI results from the following equation:
</p>

<p>
    <b>EVI = g * (N - R) / (N + c1 * R - c2 * B + l)</b><br><br>
</p>

<p>
    , where: <br><br>
    The bands are: <br><br>
    - <b>B</b> is the <b>Blue</b> band <br/>- <b>R</b> is the <b>Red</b> band <br/>- <b>N</b> is the <b>NIR</b> band <br/>
    <br><br>
    and the coefficients are:<br><br>
- <b>g</b> is the <b>Gain factor</b> coefficient <br/>- <b>l</b> is the <b>Canopy background adjustment</b> coefficient <br/>- <b>c1</b> is the <b>Coefficient 1 for the aerosol resistance term</b> coefficient <br/>- <b>c2</b> is the <b>Coefficient 2 for the aerosol resistance term</b> coefficient <br/>
</p>

<h3>EVI-Flags</h3>

<p>
    Also the processor computes an additional flags band called 'evi_flags'
    with the following bit coding:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Bit Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 0</td><td>The computed value for EVI is NAN or is Infinite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 1</td><td>The computed value for EVI is less than -1 (minus one)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 2</td><td>The computed value for EVI is greater than 1 (one)</td></tr>
