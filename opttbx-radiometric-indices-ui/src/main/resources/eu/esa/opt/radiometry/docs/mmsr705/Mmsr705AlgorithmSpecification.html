<h3>MmSR705</h3>

<p>
    The MmSR705 operator algorithm computes the <u><b>M</b></u>odified <u><b>S</b></u>imple <u><b>R</b></u>atio (705 and 445 nm)  from a given product. <br><br>
</p>


<p>
    The MmSR705 results from the following equation:
</p>

<p>
    <b>MmSR705 = (RE2 - A) / (RE2 + A)</b><br><br>
</p>

<p>
    , where: <br><br>
    The bands are: <br><br>
    - <b>A</b> is the <b>Aerosols</b> band <br/>- <b>RE2</b> is the <b>Red Edge 2</b> band <br/>- <b>R</b> is the <b>Red</b> band <br/>
    <br><br>
    
</p>

<h3>MmSR705-Flags</h3>

<p>
    Also the processor computes an additional flags band called 'mmsr705_flags'
    with the following bit coding:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Bit Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 0</td><td>The computed value for MmSR705 is NAN or is Infinite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 1</td><td>The computed value for MmSR705 is less than -1 (minus one)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 2</td><td>The computed value for MmSR705 is greater than 1 (one)</td></tr>
