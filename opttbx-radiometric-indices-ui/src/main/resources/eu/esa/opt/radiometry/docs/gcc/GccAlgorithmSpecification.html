<h3>GCC</h3>

<p>
    The GCC operator algorithm computes the <u><b>G</b></u>reen <u><b>C</b></u>hromatic <u><b>C</b></u>oordinate  from a given product. <br><br>
</p>


<p>
    The GCC results from the following equation:
</p>

<p>
    <b>GCC = G / (R + G + B)</b><br><br>
</p>

<p>
    , where: <br><br>
    The bands are: <br><br>
    - <b>B</b> is the <b>Blue</b> band <br/>- <b>G</b> is the <b>Green</b> band <br/>- <b>R</b> is the <b>Red</b> band <br/>
    <br><br>
    
</p>

<h3>GCC-Flags</h3>

<p>
    Also the processor computes an additional flags band called 'gcc_flags'
    with the following bit coding:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Bit Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 0</td><td>The computed value for GCC is NAN or is Infinite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 1</td><td>The computed value for GCC is less than -1 (minus one)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 2</td><td>The computed value for GCC is greater than 1 (one)</td></tr>
</table>
