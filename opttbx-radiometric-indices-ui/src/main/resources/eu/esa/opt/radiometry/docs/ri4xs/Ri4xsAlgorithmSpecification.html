<h3>RI4XS</h3>

<p>
    The RI4XS operator algorithm computes the <u><b>S</b></u>POT <u><b>H</b></u>RV <u><b>X</b></u>S-based <u><b>R</b></u>edness <u><b>I</b></u>ndex 4  from a given product. <br><br>
</p>


<p>
    The RI4XS results from the following equation:
</p>

<p>
    <b>RI4XS = pow(R , 2.0) / pow(G , 4.0)</b><br><br>
</p>

<p>
    , where: <br><br>
    The bands are: <br><br>
    - <b>G</b> is the <b>Green</b> band <br/>- <b>R</b> is the <b>Red</b> band <br/>
    <br><br>
    
</p>

<h3>RI4XS-Flags</h3>

<p>
    Also the processor computes an additional flags band called 'ri4xs_flags'
    with the following bit coding:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Bit Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 0</td><td>The computed value for RI4XS is NAN or is Infinite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 1</td><td>The computed value for RI4XS is less than -1 (minus one)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 2</td><td>The computed value for RI4XS is greater than 1 (one)</td></tr>
</table>
