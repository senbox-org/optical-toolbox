<h3>WI2015</h3>

<p>
    The WI2015 operator algorithm computes the <u><b>W</b></u>ater <u><b>I</b></u>ndex 2015  from a given product. <br><br>
</p>


<p>
    The WI2015 results from the following equation:
</p>

<p>
    <b>WI2015 = 1.7204 + 171 * G + 3 * R - 70 * N - 45 * S1 - 71 * S2</b><br><br>
</p>

<p>
    , where: <br><br>
    The bands are: <br><br>
    - <b>G</b> is the <b>Green</b> band <br/>- <b>R</b> is the <b>Red</b> band <br/>- <b>N</b> is the <b>NIR</b> band <br/>- <b>S1</b> is the <b>SWIR 1</b> band <br/>- <b>S2</b> is the <b>SWIR 2</b> band <br/>
    <br><br>
    
</p>

<h3>WI2015-Flags</h3>

<p>
    Also the processor computes an additional flags band called 'wi2015_flags'
    with the following bit coding:</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Bit Position</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 0</td><td>The computed value for WI2015 is NAN or is Infinite</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 1</td><td>The computed value for WI2015 is less than -1 (minus one)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Bit 2</td><td>The computed value for WI2015 is greater than 1 (one)</td></tr>
