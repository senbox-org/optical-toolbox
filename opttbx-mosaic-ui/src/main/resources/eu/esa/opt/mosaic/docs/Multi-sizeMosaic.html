<h3>Multi-size Mosaic Dialog</h3>
<b>Note</b> The Multi-size Mosaic operator is called when at least one of the input products is multi-size, otherwise the original mosaic operator is called. This is fully operational
for single granule Sentinel-2 products. In case of old products (multi granule) localisation issues may appear.

                the product or an external DEM. If you select an external DEM and it is currently not installed on your
                system,
                a dialog will appear to enable you to download and install the DEM.<br>

            <p class="i1">
                <b>East:</b>
                Specifies the eastern bound in degree which is guaranteed to be within the geographical

            <p class="i1">
                <b>North:</b>

            <p class="i1">
                <b>Pixel size X:</b>

                <b>World Map:</b>

                <b>Perform mosaic at native resolution:</b>
                If selected the created mosaic image is at the native resolution of the source products, no resample
                is produced on the source products. For the mosaic to work, the input products must have the same number of bands, the same
                band names and the bands must have the same resolution. When "Perform mosaic at native resolution" check box is
                unselected the Mosaic is performed at the resolution given by "Pixel size X" and "Pixel size Y" values. When at least one of the input products is uni-size
                the "Perform mosaic at native resolution" check box is disabled. When all the input product are uni-size the old mosaic operator is called
                and the "Perform mosaic at native resolution" check box is disabled also the Overlapping Methods is disabled.

            <p class="i1">
                <b>Overlapping Methods:</b>
                There are two types of creating a mosaic image: Blend or Overlay.
                <br> <b>Blend  :</b>  the source pixels are combined to produce the target pixels. </br>
                <br> <b>Overlay:</b>  the source pixels have a priority order depending on the order of the source products,
                First product's pixels have the highest priority and so forth.</br>
