<h3>OTB Overview</h3>

<p>Orfeo ToolBox (OTB) is an open-source project for state-of-the-art remote sensing.
    Built on the shoulders of the open-source geospatial community, it can process high resolution optical,
    multispectral and radar images at the terabyte scale. A wide variety of applications are available:
    from ortho-rectification or pansharpening, all the way to classification, SAR processing... </p>

    OTB is an external tool that can be used directly in the command line,
    but some of its application has been adapted in order to be able to execute them from SNAP.
    For using from SNAP, it is needed to install the "Optical Toolbox OTB Adapters" plugin which establishes a "bridge" between SNAP and OTB.
    As the plugin is a "bridge", it is needed to install OTB. The easiest way to install it is directly from SNAP.
