<h3>Sen2Cor Overview</h3>

<p>Sen2Cor is a processor for Sentinel-2 Level 2A product generation and formatting;
    it performs the atmospheric correction of Level-1C input data.
    Sen2Cor creates Bottom-Of-Atmosphere, optionally terrain and cirrus corrected reflectance images.
    Additionally, it generates also Aerosol Optical Thickness, Water Vapor, Scene Classification Maps and Quality Indicators
    for cloud and snow probabilities.
    Its output product format is equivalent to the Level 1C User Product:
    JPEG 2000 images, three different resolutions, 60, 20 and 10 m.</p>

<p><br>
    Sen2Cor is an external tool that can be used directly in the command line or through SNAP.
    For using from SNAP, it is needed to install the Sen2Cor plugin which establishes a "bridge" between SNAP and Sen2Cor.
    As the plugin is a "bridge", it is needed to install the tool Sen2Cor. The easiest way to install Sen2Cor is to do it directly from SNAP.
