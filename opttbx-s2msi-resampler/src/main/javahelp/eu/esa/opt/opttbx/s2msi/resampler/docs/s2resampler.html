<p>
    This option allows to resample Sentinel-2 products (in SAFE or MUSCATE format) having into account
    the particularities of the angle bands.
</p>
<p>
    Because of the discontinuity of the angles when the detector changes,
    the result of the resampling of the azimuth angle bands is not good from the
    physics point of view, since it blurs the border between detectors when we use
    a bilinear method. It is needed an specific processor to carry out the resampling
    of these bands in a "special" way.
</p>

<p>
    This operator uses not only the angles bands but also the detector footprints.
    By using the footprints, it is possible to "isolate" the angles of each detector and
    interpolate them without using the angle information of the adjacent detectors (which causes
    the blurring). In the pixels closest to the border detector-detector, it is necessary to
    extrapolate the data since not all data is available to carry out the interpolation with
    bilinear method. Finally, the angles are joined again.
</p>

<p>
    An approximation has to be made for applying this method: currently the detector footprints
    overlap and in these overlapping regions the algorithm has to decide which detector is used
    to compute the angles: it selects always the higher one.
</p>

<p>
    For extrapolating the angles, a simple algorithm is used. The angle matrix is analysed line
    by line and if a NaN is found next to two valid values, an linear extrapolation is made.
    After the processing line by line, the same step is made by columns. In the case that only one
    value is available, the surrounding pixels are set to the same value.
</p>

<p>
    The standard resampling algorithm is applied to the rest of the bands and it is possible for
    these bands to select the resampling methods, as we can do in the generic resampling operator.
