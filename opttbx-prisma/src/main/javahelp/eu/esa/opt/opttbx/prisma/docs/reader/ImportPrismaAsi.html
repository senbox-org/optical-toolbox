<h1>Prisma ASI</h1>

<p>
    Prisma is a hyperspectral satellite, capable of observing from the optical to the near infrared produced by the Italian Space Agency.<br>
    ASI (Agenzia Spaziale Italiana)
</p>
<p>
    Data products computed by ASI ground segment, can be imported by this product reader.<br>
    Additional information regarding the dataproducts, can be found here:<br>
    <a href="https://prisma.asi.it/missionselect/docs/PRISMA%20Product%20Specifications_Is2_3.pdf">
        PRISMA Products Specification Document
    </a>
</p>

<h2>Import Data</h2>
<p>
    The data is usually distributed in a zip archive. This needs to be extracted first. Afterwards the data can be
    imported via the respective entry in the application menu at '<code>File / Import / Optical Sensors /
        Prisma ASI (L1 L2B L2C L2D)</code>'.
</p>
<p>
    Of course it is also possible to simply use the open dialog from the menu '<code>File / Open Product...</code>'
    or the toolbar. Here by default the generic reader is used. <br><br>
</p>
<p>
    Another option to open Prisma data is to drag'n'drop the extracted <code>*.he5</code> files onto the
    Product Explorer in SNAP.
</p>

<h2>Data Access</h2>
<p>
    A description of how and where you can obtain Prisma data can be found on the website of the Italian Space Agency
    under the heading:<br>
