<h3>Import EnMAP</h3>

<p>
    The Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) is a German hyper-spectral satellite mission to monitoring
    and
    characterise Earth?s environment on a global scale.</p>
<h4>Sensor Characteristics</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Imaging push-broom hyper-spectral sensor mainly based on modified existing or pre-developed technology
    </li>
    <li>Broad spectral range from 420 nm to 1000 nm (VNIR) and from 900 nm to 2450 nm (SWIR) with high radiometric
        resolution and stability in both spectral ranges
    </li>
    <li>30 km swath width at high spatial resolution of 30 m x 30 m and off-nadir (30°) pointing feature for fast target
        revisit (4 days)
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Open a Data Product</h4>
<p>To open a product select in the file chooser either a file in the unzipped directory or
    the distributed zip extracted from the distribution package or the tar.gz distribution itself. Alternatively you can drag the files directly from the
    system file explorer on the Product Explorer in SNAP. For distribution packages that contain more than one product, SNAP will open only the first product.<br>
    In terms of reading speed, the unzipped data access is the fastest, whereas reading data from the distribution package has the slowest reading performance.<br>
    Supported EnMAP products are Level-1B, Level-1C and Level-2A in GeoTiff format.<br><br>
    You find the zipped product data file in the distributed *.tar.gz package.
    For example, the zip file is located at this path:<br>
    <code>dims_op_oc_oc-en_700341844_1.tar.gz\dims_op_oc_oc-en_700341844_1.tar\dims_op_oc_oc-en_700341844_1\ENMAP.HSI.L1B\ENMAP-HSI-L1BDT0000005053_01-2022-11-05T10:40:58.971_2022-11-20T01:41:58\</code>
