<h3>Import EnMAP</h3>

<p>
    The Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) is a German hyper-spectral satellite mission to monitoring
    and
    characterise Earth?s environment on a global scale.</p>
<h4>Sensor Characteristics</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Imaging push-broom hyper-spectral sensor mainly based on modified existing or pre-developed technology
    </li>
    <li>Broad spectral range from 420 nm to 1000 nm (VNIR) and from 900 nm to 2450 nm (SWIR) with high radiometric
        resolution and stability in both spectral ranges
    </li>
    <li>30 km swath width at high spatial resolution of 30 m x 30 m and off-nadir (30°) pointing feature for fast target
        revisit (4 days)
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Open a Data Product</h4>
<p>To open a product select in the file chooser either a file in the unzipped directory or
    directly the distributed zip file. Alternatively you can drag the files directly from the
    system file explorer on the Product Explorer in SNAP.<br>
    Supported EnMAP products are Level-1B, Level-1C and Level-2A in GeoTiff format.<br><br>
    You find the zipped product data file in the distributed *.tar.gz package.
    For example, the zip file is located at this path:<br>
    <code>dims_op_oc_oc-en_700341844_1.tar.gz\dims_op_oc_oc-en_700341844_1.tar\dims_op_oc_oc-en_700341844_1\ENMAP.HSI.L1B\ENMAP-HSI-L1BDT0000005053_01-2022-11-05T10:40:58.971_2022-11-20T01:41:58\</code>
