<h3>ECOSTRESS Mission Overview</h3>

<p>
    The ECOSTRESS instrument measures the temperature of plants and uses that information to better understand how much
    water plants need and how they respond to stress.
</p>
<p>
    ECOSTRESS addresses three overarching science questions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>How is the terrestrial biosphere responding to changes in water availability?</li>
    <li>How do changes in diurnal vegetation water stress impact the global carbon cycle?</li>
    <li>Can agricultural vulnerability be reduced through advanced monitoring of agricultural water consumptive use and
        improved drought estimation?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The ECOSTRESS mission answers these questions by accurately measuring the temperature
    of plants. Plants regulate their temperature by releasing water through tiny pores on their
    leaves called stomata. If they have sufficient water, they can maintain their temperature. However, if there is
    insufficient water, their temperatures rise. This temperature rise can
    be measured with a sensor in space. ECOSTRESS uses a multispectral thermal infrared (TIR)
    radiometer to measure the surface temperature, deployed on the International Space Station. The instrument will
    measure radiances at 5 spectral bands in the 8-12.5 ÔÅ≠m range with approximately 38 meter by 57 meter of spatial
    resolution on the ground.
</p>

<h3>ECOSTRESS Data Products</h3>

<p>
    The ECOSTRESS mission will generate 13 different distributable data products. The products represent four levels of
    data processing, with data granules defined as an image scene. Each image scene consists of 44 scans of the
    instrument mirror, each scan taking approximately 1.181 seconds, and each image scene taking approximately 52
    seconds. Each image scene starts at the beginning of the first target area encountered during each orbit. Each orbit
    is defined as the equatorial crossing of an ascending International Space Station (ISS) orbit.
</p>
<p>
    ECOSTRESS Level 0 data include spacecraft packets that have been pre-processed by the Ground Data System (GDS).
    Level 1 products include spacecraft engineering data, the time-tagged raw sensor pixels appended with their
    radiometric calibration coefficients, the blackbody pixels used to generate the calibration coefficients, geolocated
    and radiometrically calibrated at-sensor radiances of each image pixel, the geolocation tags of each pixel, and the
    corrected spacecraft attitude data. Level 2 products include the land surface temperature and emissivity for each
    spectral band retrieved from the at-sensor radiance data, and a cloud mask. Level 2 products also appear in image
    scene granules. Level 3 products include evapotranspiration data derived from Level 2 products. Level 4 products
    include evaporative stress index and water use efficiency derived from Level 3 data.
