<h3>Processor Description</h3>

<h4>I/O Parameters Tab</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="images/CloudProbProcessorGUI.png"></p>
<h5>Source Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Name: </b>
    Used to select the spectral source product. The source product shall
    contain spectral bands providing a source spectrum at each pixel. Use the <b>...</b> button to
    open a data product currently not opened in the application.
</p>

<h5>Target Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Name:</b>
    Used to specify the name of the target product.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Save to:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be saved to the file system. The
    combo box presents a list of file formats. If ENVISAT is selected the source product must be in ENVISAT format too.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Open in SNAP:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be opened in the application.
    When the target product is not saved, it is opened automatically.
</p>


<h3>Advanced configuration</h3>

<p>The algorithm uses two different neural nets. The first for usage over land and the second for usage
    over the open ocean. By default, every pixel with an altitude below -50m is treated as ocean.</p>
 <p>This selection can be edited in the config files, which together with the neural nets are unpacked 
 into a subdirectory of the user directory. The subdirectory used is 
 <code>.snap/snap-meris-cloud/auxdata</code>
 The file <code>cloud_config.txt</code> specifies which configuration for the land and the ocean case are used.
 In the respective configuration files following properties are of interest:
 <ul>
 	<li>The property <code>neural_net</code> specifies the filename of the neural net to use.</li>
 	<li>The property <code>validExpression</code> gives a boolean expression,
	which is used to select between the land and the ocean net.<br/>
	First the validExpression for land is evaluated and if <code>true</code> the land net is used.
	As a second option the expression for the ocean net is evaluated.
	If neither of the two expressions evaluate to true, the no-data value is set.
	</li>
 </ul>
