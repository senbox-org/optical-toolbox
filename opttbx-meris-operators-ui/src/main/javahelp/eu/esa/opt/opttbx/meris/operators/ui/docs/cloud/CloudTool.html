    The SNAP Cloud Probability Processor implements the detection of clouds in a MERIS L1b product.
    The created output product contains one raster indicating the probability that the current pixel is a cloud pixel,
    and three additional flags to the already present l1_flags. The three flags indicate pixels which are cloudy
    (probability &gt; 80%),
    cloud free (probability &lt; 20%) or where it is uncertain (20% &lt; probability &lt; 80%).
