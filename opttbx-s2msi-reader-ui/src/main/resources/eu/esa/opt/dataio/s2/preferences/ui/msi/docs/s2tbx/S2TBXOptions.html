<h5>Sentinel-2 Masks</h5>
<p>
    The Sentinel-2 products contain different kind of masks in GML format or newly JPEG2000 format. By default, all the masks are loaded
    but the user can select to ignore some of them in order to be able to open the products faster.
</p>
<h5>Sentinel-2 AUX data</h5>
<p>
    The Sentinel-2 products contain ECMWFT auxilary data and also from the PSD 14.8 CAMSFO auxilary data. By default, all the auxilary data are loaded
    but the user can select to ignore some of them in order to be able to open the products faster.
</p>
<h5>Sentinel-2 radiometric negative offset</h5>
<p>
    From the PSD 14.8, a radiometric offset will be added up to the image reflectance at Level-1C (also at Level-2A).
    By default, the band are loaded without the negative offset, but the user can select to add the negative offset.
