<h3>Import MODIS Product</h3>

<h4> Implementation of the MODIS Product Reader</h4>

<p>This implementation supports a subset of the products available of the NASA sensor MODIS,
    both on the Aqua and Terra platform. These products can be imported into the SNAP,
    used as input products in the scientific data processors (where applicable)
    and accessed by Java developers using the Java product I/O framework.
</p>

<h4>Supported MODIS Data Products</h4>

<p>The following MODIS data product types are supported by SNAP:

    <tr><td><code>MOD13A2</code><br><code>MYD13A2</code></td>
        <td>MODIS/Terra/Aqua Vegetation Indices 16-Day L3 Global 1km</td>
        <td>Global MODIS vegetation indices are designed to provide consistent spatial and temporal
            comparisons of vegetation conditions. Blue, red, and near-infrared reflectances, centered
            at 469-nanometers, 645-nanometers, and 858-nanometers, respectively, are used to determine
            the MODIS daily vegetation indices.<br>
            The MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) complements NOAA's Advanced Very
            High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI products and provides continuity for time series
            historical applications. MODIS also includes a new Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) that
            minimizes canopy background variations and maintains sensitivity over dense vegetation
            conditions. The EVI also uses the blue band to remove residual atmosphere contamination
            caused by smoke and sub-pixel thin cloud clouds. The MODIS NDVI and EVI products are
            computed from atmospherically corrected bi-directional surface reflectances that have
            been masked for water, clouds, heavy aerosols, and cloud shadows.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>MOD15A2</code><br><code>MYD15A2</code></td>
        <td>MODIS/Terra/Aqua Leaf Area Index - Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation 8-Day L4 Global 1km</td>

            Radiation (FPAR) product is composited every 8 days at 1-kilometer resolution on a
            Sinusoidal grid. Science Data Sets provided in the MOD15A2 include LAI, FPAR, a quality
            rating, and standard deviation for each variable.<br>
            The LAI variable defines the number of equivalent layers of leaves relative to a unit of
            ground area, whereas FPAR measures the proportion of available radiation in the
            photosynthetically active wavelengths that are absorbed by a canopy. Both variables
            are used as satellite-derived parameters for calculating surface photosynthesis,
            evapotranspiration, and net primary production, which in turn are used to calculate
            terrestrial energy, carbon, water cycle processes, and biogeochemistry of vegetation.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><code>MOD09GA</code><br><code>MYD09GA</code></td>
        <td>MODIS/Terra/Aqua Surface Reflectance Daily L2G Global 1km and 500m</td>
        <td>The MODIS Surface Reflectance products provide an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance
            as it would be measured at ground level in the absence of atmospheric scattering or absorption.
            Low-level data are corrected for atmospheric gases and aerosols, yielding a level-2 basis for
            several higher-order gridded level-2 (L2G) and level-3 products.<br>
            MOD09GA provides Bands 1-7 in a daily gridded L2G product in the Sinusoidal projection,
            including 500-meter reflectance values and 1-kilometer observation and geolocation
            statistics. 500-m Science Data Sets provided for this product include reflectance
            for Bands 1-7, a quality rating, observation coverage, observation number, and 250-m scan
            information. 1-kilometer Science Data Sets provided include number of observations,
            quality state, sensor angles, solar angles, geolocation flags, and orbit pointers.</td></tr>

<h4>MODIS Level 2 Products</h4>

<p>The supported MODIS Level 2 products do not contain geo-location information. Instead, this
    information is stored in an accompanying quality control file (<code>MxDOCQC</code>). The SNAP software tries
    to locate this file in the same directory as the Level 2 product resides. If the geo-location file is not
    present, the Level 2 product will be opened as raw datasets without geo-coding.
</p>

<h4>MODIS Quality Flags</h4>

<p>The current version does not support flag coding of MODIS products and therefore
    bitmask overlays are currently not possible.
