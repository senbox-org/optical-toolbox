<h3>Algorithm Specification</h3>

<p>
    The two OLCI instruments operating on the Sentinel 3A and 3B platforms share a common instrument design.
    Nevertheless, there are small differences in the spectral characteristics, between the different cameras of each
    OLCI instrument, as well as between the OLCI-A and B instruments. Further, the radiometric and spectral calibration
    has uncertainties which eventually lead to small differences in the instrument measurements. Together this can
    impact downstream processing.<br>

    To be able to quantify the instrument characteristic deviations ESA maneouvered the Sentinel 3B platform in an early
    phase of the mission into a "tandem configuration" where it followed the Sentinel 3A platform on the same orbit
    with a 30 seconds delay. This configuration allows for measurements over the same ground targets with almost the
    same atmospheric conditions, hence for comparable measurements.<br>

    The recommendations resulting from the analysis of acquisitions taken during the tandem phase are implemented in
    this processor. These are a "homogenisation" process and a "sensor cross-calibration".

<ul>
    <li>Homogenisation: the homogenisation aims at correcting the inter-camera differences of each OLCI instrument. It
        applies a camera specific gain correction on the radiances measured so that measurements of all cameras appear
        to be measured with the same camera sensitivity (so called "flat fielding").
    </li>

    <li>
        Cross calibration: this process applies the homogenisation process and on top of this applies sensor
        inter-calibration coefficients on the radiances measured. It does this by implementing the linear-regression
        approach described in reference [1] using the per-pixel detector wavelength.
    </li>
</ul>
