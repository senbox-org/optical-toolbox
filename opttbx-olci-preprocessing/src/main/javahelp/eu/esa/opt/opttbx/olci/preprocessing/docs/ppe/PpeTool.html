<p>Cosmic rays and massive charged particles trapped in the magnetosphere or arriving from the sun might produce spike
    noise over the dark offset signal coming from charge-coupled devices (CCDs) on optic sensors such as Ocean and Land
    Color Instrument (Sentinel-3/OLCI) and Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (Envisat/MERIS). These phenomena are
    called prompt particle events (PPEs) and in the case of OLCI, are the cause of isolated across-track pixel stripes
    present at the L1B imagery.<br>
    The PPE filtering operator removes such stripes from the imagery for OLCI L1B.
