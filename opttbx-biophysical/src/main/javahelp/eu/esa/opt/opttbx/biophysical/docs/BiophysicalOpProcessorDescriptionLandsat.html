<h3>Processor Description</h3>

The <i>Biophysical Processor LANDSAT8</i> is optimized to use a LANDSAT8 product as input instead of a Sentinel2 product, however it is only capable of computing <i>LAI</i>, <i>FAPAR</i> and <i>FVC</i> indexes.

<h4>I/O Parameters Tab</h4>

<h5>Source Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Name: </b>
    Used to select the spectral source product. The source product shall
    be a LANDSAT8 product. Use the <b>...</b> button to
    open a data product currently not opened in the Sentinel Toolbox.
    The algorithm is calibrated for top-of-canopy reflectances and depends
    on the acquisition geometry, so it requires slope-effect corrected reflectances
    to give optimal results
</p>

<h5>Target Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Name:</b>
    Used to specify the name of the target product.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Save to:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be saved to the file system. The
    combo box presents a list of file formats.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Open in SNAP:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be opened in the Sentinel Toolbox.
    When the target product is not saved, it is opened in the Sentinel Toolbox automatically.
</p>

<h4>Processing Parameters Tab</h4>

<ol>
    <p class="i1">
        <b>Compute LAI: </b><br>
        Enable/Disable the computation of LAI (Leaf Area Index) in the output product
    </p>

    <p class="i1">
        <b>Compute FAPAR: </b><br>
        Enable/Disable the computation of FAPAR (Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation) in the output product
    </p>

    <p class="i1">
        <b>Compute FVC: </b><br>
        Enable/Disable the computation of FVC (Fraction of Vegetation Cover) in the output product
    </p>
</ol>
